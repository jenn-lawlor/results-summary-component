### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties** (variables)
- **Grid Layout**
- linear and radial gradients

### What I learned

I learned a ton building this component.  I had never worked with gradients before, so this was good practice.

I also enjoyed working with grid layout, included nested grids for the list items.  I think it's really cool to figure out how it works and how I can manipulate layouts using responsive grid-template-columns.
